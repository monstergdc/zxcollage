# zxcollage
ZX image collage generator in Python

# Generate your very own poster with collage of subjectively curated ZX Spectrum images from https://zxart.ee

# Online version: [here](https://jakub.noniewicz.com/zxcollage/).

# The idea:

It takes random images from c.a. ~3500 preselected by me and fits them (some, as many as possible) nicely in one big collage. Released at Speccy.pl party 2025 in wild category competition. However the concept was misunderstood by the organizers as they did not show the attached readme which was supposed to explain that it is a generator and not some finished image. One may notice a fascinating thing here: how many and how different cultural references there are in this collection of ZX Spectrum graphics. 

# Note:

Requires [pyzx48tools](https://github.com/monstergdc/pyzx48tools/) for scr to png conversion.
